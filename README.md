# **FashionMNIST ONNX Classifier**

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying FashionMNIST dataset images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with PyTorch, exported to ONNX format, and deployed in a React-based web application. The deployed application allows users to upload an image, preprocess it, and classify it using the trained ONNX model.

## **Overview**

### **Jupyter Notebook Workflow**

1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The FashionMNIST dataset is loaded using `torchvision.datasets`.
   - Normalization is applied to ensure consistent pixel value ranges.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets and visualized using Matplotlib.

2. **Mean and Standard Deviation Calculation**:
   - The mean and standard deviation of the dataset are calculated to fine-tune the normalization process.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed with:
     - **Convolutional layers** to extract spatial features.
     - **Fully connected layers** for classification into 10 classes (e.g., T-shirt, trouser, bag).
   - The model is trained on the dataset using the AdamW optimizer and CrossEntropy loss.

4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - A training loop is implemented to update the model weights.
   - Accuracy and loss metrics are logged using TensorBoard.

5. **Model Export to ONNX**:
   - The trained PyTorch model is exported to ONNX format using `torch.onnx.export` for deployment.
   - Dynamic axes are defined for handling variable batch sizes.

6. **Inference with ONNX Runtime**:
   - The exported model is tested with ONNX Runtime to ensure consistency with the PyTorch implementation.

### **Frontend: Image Preprocessing and Prediction**

The React web application preprocesses user-uploaded images and passes them to the ONNX model for classification:

1. **Image Upload**:
   - Users can upload an image using an Ant Design file uploader.
   - The uploaded image is displayed for preview.

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - The image is resized to **28x28 pixels** and converted to grayscale to match the FashionMNIST dataset format.
   - Pixel values are normalized using the mean and standard deviation calculated during training.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The preprocessed image is converted to a tensor and fed into the ONNX model.
   - The model outputs a probability for each class.
   - The top predictions are displayed with their respective probabilities as percentages.

4. **User Interface**:
   - The probabilities are visually represented with progress bars (Ant Design components).
   - The prediction results are displayed dynamically after inference.
